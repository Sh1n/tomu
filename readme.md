# ToMu

ToMu, or To Museum, is an mobile-first application developed in Laravel 5.2.
It was part of a startup MVP which was aimed at giving to the visitors of an Italian contemporary
art exhibition the possibility to improve their experience with quiz and activities 
associated to each piece of art.

The code was made by [me](https://www.linkedin.com/in/francescobux), while the UX/UI part was made by [Federica Corneli](https://www.behance.net/federicacoe09b)
